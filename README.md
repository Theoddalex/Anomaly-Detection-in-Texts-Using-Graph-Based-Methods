# Anomaly Detection in Texts Using Graph Methods

This repository contains the implementation and documentation for our project on anomaly detection using **Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) on k-NN graphs**. The project explores the use of **BERT embeddings** and **spectral graph analysis** to identify textual anomalies in multilingual datasets.

## Repository Structure  

- **Anomaly Detection in Texts Using Graph Methods - Part A**  
  - A detailed report covering the theoretical foundation and methodology of the project.

- **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`)**  
  - An interactive implementation of the anomaly detection pipeline, which includes:  
    - Loading and preprocessing textual data from **Project Gutenberg**  
    - Constructing a **k-NN graph** using **BERT embeddings**  
    - Applying **Graph Fourier Transform (GFT)** for anomaly detection  
    - Evaluating different **k values** to optimize performance  

- **Anomaly Detection in Texts Using Graph Methods - Part B**  
  - A continuation of the project documentation, including analysis, results, and conclusions.

- **Pipeline Process Video**  
  - A recorded demonstration of the anomaly detection pipeline, illustrating the key steps and findings.

- **Project Poster**  
  - A visual summary of the project, highlighting key findings, improvements, and future directions.
